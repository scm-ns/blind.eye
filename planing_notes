Used to keep track of what has been done and what is to be done.

April 14th : 2017
	- Work on better UI
	- Work on adding right button 

currnt : 
	create new super cell for showing the faces
	add the cell to the collectoin view 
	make the faces show up in a cell 	
work queue : 
	create up button for showing details about tensorlfow
	create top-left button for showing menu
	make the cell rounded for cell showing		

desgin questions : 
	why is the view controller used to transport data. Show the VC be segregated to handling views alone.
			but it is a view controller, does that not mean that it can be used to control data flow ? 	
	
Micro plans : 
	Create better UI
	Retain network using AWS. No use simpler network for first release later work on improvement

Plans : 
	Release app to app store : March 12th, 2017
