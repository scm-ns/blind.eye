    This class takes in the camera data in the form of the pixel buffer and does 
    face recognition of the pixel buffer 
 
    How to share the pixel buffer between multiple consumers ?
 
    It is GPU data, but I am locking it and keeping it in the CPU.
    But since I am not writing to it, I should be able to use it from multiple threads.
